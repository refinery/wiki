# RefineryCMS Wiki idea

The plan here is that we create a sort of a wiki that plugs into Refinery CMS.
When you go to /wiki/ on a site, you should see the wiki (of course you could route it to root_url if you wanted to).

## Why?

Well, eventually we want to move http://tutorials.refinerycms.org to this sort of setup. So a few of us will be working on functionality for the new system here, in this wee engine.

## How can I help?

Come talk to us on IRC:

    irc.freenode.net
    #refinerycms

Or, if you have an aversion to Internet chatting over the relay, you may fork this project and contribute some functionality that you feel we're desperately missing. Either way, we'd _love_ your help.  If you're extra good, you'll get commit rights to the core repository (hint: this one) if you want them.

## What if I'm not a super good programmer?

In that case, you're probably better than you think you are. Give it a go! We're here to help because we really want this thing to fly so you're in good hands.

If you really don't want to be doing programming, perhaps you can help with implementation ideas (i.e. what this system will do, how it'll work for the user) or maybe you're a great designer and could give us a hand with icons and user interface design.
